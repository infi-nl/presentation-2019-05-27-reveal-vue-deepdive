          aside.notes
            p ancient ... but it was a huge success, many devs started building large scale SPA's for the first time.
        li.fragment(data-fragment-index="2") 2013 React
          aside.notes 
            p introduced us to this new concept called the virtual DOM
            p The DOM is a data structure that you define in your HTML.
            p The DOM can be represented as a data structure in Javascript, too.
            p Why do this? Because itâ€™s expensive to update the DOM, but not expensive to update the virtual DOM.
            p A typical page exists of thousands of DOM nodes, and having many small updates slows down the page.
            p This approach was revolutionary, and many other frameworks would later also use virtual DOM, including VueJS.
        li.fragment(data-fragment-index="3") 2014 VueJS
          aside.notes 
            p Evan You open-sourced his pet project
            p Got picked up by Laravell community
            p React's license was too strict for Apache Foundation, who took the drastic step of banning the library
            p That's when a lot of React developers noticed that Vue was a viable alternative to React.
